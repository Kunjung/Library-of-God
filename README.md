# Pikachu's Community Library
A Good book that costs $8.00 is too expensive for students in Nepal. The best way to make it affordable to get expensive books is to share it, like in a library.
But a library is mostly centered in the capital center which makes it time consuming to make the long distance trips back and forth. So, a virtual library among local people living close together is the best option.

## The 3 Minute Presentation for the Idea

## The Elevator Pitch
### Some Criticism on the Idea: 
1. I would like to admit that there need not be a web app for doing this and the students should be able to make a collective library among their own friends. (But it would be of a limited size of maximum 50)

2. There are a lot of ebooks that can simply be downloaded and read online. So maybe there's no need to have physical books anymore.

### Response to the Criticism:
1. So, what is special about the app is that it implements the Gale Shapley Algorithm. The same algorithm used to match kidney donors with suitable hosts and also in dating apps. The algorithm makes matches among the best pairs and since it can be implemented in software to make matches possible among a very large group of up to 500 to 1000 individuals.

2. The problem with ebooks is distraction. A Physical book serves as a single purpose tool for knowledge. But a smartphone has too many distractions in it (facebook, phone calls, messages, instagram, music). In that sense, physical books still serve the purpose of focusing the mind of the individual.
